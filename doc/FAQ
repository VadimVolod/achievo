Achievo Frequently Asked Questions
==================================

If you have a question about Achievo, try to find the answer below.
If you can't find it, mail your question to the Achievo mailinglist.

Note: In the answers below, we sometimes refer to menu items or fields in 
Achievo. We use the english terms, so if you use a different language, 
the terms might be different.


1. Log in questions
-------------------

 1.1. What is the password for the Achievo demo on your site?
 
        The username is 'administrator', the password is 'demo'.

 1.2. I just installed Achievo for the first time and I try to login. 
      What's the username and password?   
   
        The username is 'administrator', the default password is 'demo'.   
   
 1.3. When I try to login, all I get is a message 'Failed to logon',
      and I'm sure the password is correct.

        If you run PHP as a cgi-module, you can't use the login protocol
        we use. We will fix this in the future. 
   
 1.4. How can I change the administrator password?
 
        The administrator password is set in the config.inc.php3 file, not in
        the database. See also question 5.     
        
  
2. User preferences
-------------------

 2.1. When I use 'user preferences' for administrator, I get an error message
      when I try to save.
    
        The administrator is not a real user. His account is set in the 
        config.inc.php3 file. This is useful when your database is down or
        corrupted but you still need to login.
      
        You can create a 'real' account for administrator if you want.
        In the 'Security Profiles' section, create a profile that has
        all access privileges. In the 'Employee Administration' section,
        create a user with userid 'administrator' and whatever name and
        password you like. Then disable the config account by putting //
        in front of the line with $config_administratorpassword.


3. Time Registration
--------------------

 3.1. The dropdown for 'Project/Phase' is empty, but I am sure I created 
      projects and phases.
    
        This is not a bug, this is a feature. The dropdown is like a 'recent 
        documents' option most applications have. It only contains the last
        projects you used, so you can quickly access them. If a project you
        want to use is not in the dropdown, click the link 'Search all 
        projects and phases'.
      
 3.2. When I change the date, the date jumps to january and I am unable 
      to change it. (Mozilla/Netscape 6)

        There is a bug in some Mozilla 0.9.x and Netscape 6.x releases that
        causes this behaviour:
        http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86659
        There is currently no workaround for this bug.

 3.3. When I edit an entry, the activity is not set correctly. (Mozilla/
      Netscape 6)

        This is caused by the same Mozilla bug that causes the problem from 
        question 3.2.
