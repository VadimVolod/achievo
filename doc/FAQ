Achievo Frequently Asked Questions
==================================

If you have a question about Achievo, try to find the answer below.
If you can't find it, mail your question to the Achievo mailinglist.

Note: In the answers below, we sometimes refer to menu items or fields in 
Achievo. We use the english terms, so if you use a different language, 
the terms might be different.

1. Installation 
---------------

 1.1. I have installed Achievo, and I am getting the following error:
      Fatal error: Call to unsupported or undefined function 
      mysql_pconnect()      

        Make sure you installed MySQL, and check if you enabled MySQL 
        support in PHP. If you built PHP from source, this means you have
        to recompile it with MySQL support (Check the PHP documentation for
        instructions on how to do this). 
        If you installed PHP from rpms, you have to install the corresponding 
        php-mysql rpm.
        
        
2. Logging in to Achievo
------------------------

 2.1. What is the password for the Achievo demo on your site?
 
        The username is 'administrator', the password is 'demo'.

 2.2. I just installed Achievo for the first time and I try to login. 
      What's the username and password?   
   
        The username is 'administrator', the default password is 'demo'.   
   
 2.3. When I try to login, all I get is a message 'Failed to logon',
      and I'm sure the password is correct.

        If you run PHP as a cgi-module, you can't use the login protocol
        we use. We will fix this in the future. 
   
 2.4. How can I change the administrator password?
 
        The administrator password is set in the config.inc.php3 file, not in
        the database. See also question 5.     
        
  
3. User preferences
-------------------

 3.1. When I use 'user preferences' for administrator, I get an error message
      when I try to save.
    
        The administrator is not a real user. His account is set in the 
        config.inc.php file. This is useful when your database is down or
        corrupted but you still need to login.
      
        You can create a 'real' account for administrator if you want.
        In the 'Security Profiles' section, create a profile that has
        all access privileges. In the 'Employee Administration' section,
        create a user with userid 'administrator' and whatever name and
        password you like. Then disable the config account by putting //
        in front of the line with $config_administratorpassword.


4. Time Registration
--------------------

 4.1. The dropdown for 'Project/Phase' is empty, but I am sure I created 
      projects and phases.
    
        This is not a bug, this is a feature. The dropdown is like a 'recent 
        documents' option most applications have. It only contains the last
        projects you used, so you can quickly access them. If a project you
        want to use is not in the dropdown, click the link 'Search all 
        projects and phases'.       

 4.2. When I edit an entry, the activity is not set correctly. (Mozilla/
      Netscape 6)

        There is a bug in some Mozilla 0.9.x and Netscape 6.x releases that
        causes this behaviour:
        http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86659
        Mozilla 0.9.4 no longer has this bug, so upgrading Mozilla should 
        help.
