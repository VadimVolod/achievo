Depite our efforts to keep this UPGRADE file as accurate as possible, there
might be situations in which the described procedure does not work.
In this case send an email to ivo@achievo.com or to the mailinglist
(achievo@achievo.com) and we will try to help you out.

Upgrading from version 0.4.x -> 0.6
-----------------------------------
The database structure has changed a lot between 0.4.x and 0.6, so there
are a few steps that you need to do to convert your old database to be
compatible with Achievo 0.6.
Note that the upgrade procedure does not affect your old database, so
it's safe to try the conversion.

1. First install Achievo 0.6 to a new directory (leave your existing 
   Achievo installation in place), using the achievo.sql 
   file, as described in the INSTALL file. 
   When creating the database, make sure you create a new one, don't use
   your existing database.
   For example: if your current Achievo database is called 'achievo', create 
   a new database that you call 'achievo_0_6'.
   
2. Set an administrator password by editing the config.inc.php3 file and
   changing the $config_administratorpassword setting.
    
3. Edit the file convert.php3 and change the settings in the script.
   
4. Point your browser to the convert.php3 script. 
   For example: http://myserver/achievo_0.6/convert.php3
   
5. The way we handle user passwords has changed in Achievo 0.6. Since there
   is no way to decode the existing passwords, we can't convert the existing
   passwords. If you have not set a default password for users in the 
   convert.php3 script, you must now login to your new Achievo installation,
   and use 'Employee Administration' to set a password for every user. 
   If you set a default password, users can login using this default password
   and change their own password.
 
6. Finally, log into Achievo, go to the 'Security Profiles' section and edit 
   the 'Default Group'. You have to grant permissions to this profile, since
   every converted user is put in this default profile.
   
The Achievo upgrade is now complete. If you have any questions, please join 
the mailinglist by sending an empty message to achievo-subscribe@achievo.com.
